    <h3>An omelet is a dish you might order for breakfast or brunch â€” <br>
        it's kind of like a folded pancake made of beaten eggs, <br> sometimes with the addition of vegetables,
        <br> cheese, or meat. Yum. 
        A good omelet is a little bit fluffy, but firm enough to contain its filling.</h3>
